"""this code ensures that the user receives the latest latest data of any user whenever they please. So we use 2..
... dictionaries and initially, both the dictionaries contain the same data from the json file. Once the user searches...
... for a specific user's data, the data is given from dict a. But, if another user edits dict_a, and updates their own...
.. data, their edit is copied to another variable, and is put into dict_b. Now Dict_b is used for editing and dict_a is for...
... the users who want to read the file data"""
